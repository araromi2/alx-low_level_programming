| `0-object_like_macro.h`   | A header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.       | [header file 1](https://github.com/araromi2/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h)   |
| `1-pi.h`                  | A header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359` | [header file 2](https://github.com/araromi2/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h)                  |
| `2-main.c`                | A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.       | [print file name](https://github.com/araromi2/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c)              |
| `3-function_like_macro.h` | A function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`                | [header file 3](https://github.com/araromi2/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h) |
| `4-sum.h`                 | A function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`             | [header file 4](https://github.com/araromi2/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h)                 |
